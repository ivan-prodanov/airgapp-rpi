# Stuff a freshly-flashed SD card's bootfs partition with Airgapp's
# first-boot payload so the Pi sets itself up on first power-on.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Flash "Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit, Trixie)" with Raspberry Pi Imager.
#      In Advanced Settings (gear icon):
#        - hostname: airgapp
#        - set a user (e.g. pi / your password)
#        - enable SSH (password or public-key)
#        - set locale / timezone
#        - LEAVE WIRELESS LAN UNCONFIGURED (wlan0 must be free for AP mode)
#   2. Re-insert the SD so the bootfs partition is mounted.
#   3. Build the arm64 binary:
#        CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o netfilterd-arm64 ./cmd/netfilterd
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/prepare-sd.sh <path-to-bootfs>
#   e.g. on Windows Git Bash:
#        scripts/prepare-sd.sh /e         # if bootfs is drive E:

set -euo pipefail

WARNING: no user-data or firstrun.sh found on bootfs.

You almost certainly skipped Raspberry Pi Imager's customization step
(gear icon in the final screen). Without it, the Pi has no user configured
and SSH is disabled — you will not be able to log in. Re-flash using the
Advanced / OS Customisation settings.
